Melanoma is recognized as one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, and its timely diagnosis can significantly increase patientsâ€™ chances of survival. The diversity of melanoma types and its visual similarity to other skin lesions pose substantial challenges for accurate identification. Since manual examination of skin lesion images by specialists is time-consuming and prone to error, automating this process using machine learning and deep learning approaches has attracted considerable attention. However, many existing methods either lack sufficient generalization ability due to reliance on a single architecture and centralized data, or fail to provide adequate accuracy in extracting distinctive features from skin images. Therefore, in this study, a federated deep learning model is proposed for the automatic detection of melanoma. The proposed architecture incorporates two types of local networks: first, a lightweight network based on the Shuffle Block; and second, a network equipped with the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to adaptively focus on important features. The federated learning process was conducted using five local models comprising these two structures, and evaluations were performed on two well-known datasets: HAM10000 and ISIC 2019. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FDL-CBAM method achieved accuracies of 98.8% on HAM10000 and 94.1% on ISIC 2019, with a performance improvement of over 2% compared to reference methods. The FDL-ShuffleBlock method achieved accuracies of 91.44% on HAM10000 and 92.32% on ISIC 2019, showing performance improvements of 1% to 3% over some baseline methods.
